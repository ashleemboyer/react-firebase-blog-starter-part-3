## Changelog

### Monday, September 2nd, 2019

Some changes were made to [`src/pages/home.js`](https://github.com/ashleemboyer/react-firebase-blog-starter-part-3/blob/master/src/pages/home.js) based on updates to the [part 1](https://github.com/ashleemboyer/react-firebase-blog-starter) and [part 2](https://github.com/ashleemboyer/react-firebase-blog-starter-part-2) repositories. The `Create` component ([`src/pages/create.js`](https://github.com/ashleemboyer/react-firebase-blog-starter-part-3/blob/master/src/pages/create.js)) was updated to reflect some of these changes. Two dates are now generated, `datePretty` and `dateFormatted`. The pretty date is used for display purposes and the formatted one is used for sorting posts chronologically on the home page.
